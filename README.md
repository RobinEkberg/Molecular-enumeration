# Molecular enumeration
The code was created to generate a large number of molecules based on SMIRKS reactions. This allows for creation of a library of molecules that can be filtered using a Lipinski-like filter. The molecules can later be docked using AutoDock Vina. If another docking program is to be used, the code writes **.sdf**-files for each generated conformer.

# Input
All molecule input can be done using SMILES or .mol-files.
